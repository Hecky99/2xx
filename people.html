  <p>Education is the key to the future: You’ve heard it a million times, and it’s not wrong. Educated people have higher wages and lower unemployment rates, and better-educated countries grow faster and innovate more than other countries. But going to college is not enough. You also have to study the right subjects.<br /><em>- Alex Tabarrok</em></p>

Also, he would hang out with the not so good kids so that is another reason why sometimes we wouldn’t talk because of not wanting to get involved in doing bad things with him.
